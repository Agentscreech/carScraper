# carScraper
This is a web scraper that scrapes AutoTrader for a very specific type of car.

It grabs the results, then scrapes the results to get the details of the car. 

Taking the VIN from the details page of the listing it will then grab the pdf of the window sticker from the manufacturer.

All of this is displayed in an Angular app that shows all the details of the car including the PDF for maximum fidelity in searching for the perfect car.
